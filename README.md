## Usage
Make sure that a server is running on your WiFi.
The server can only connect you to people on your internet, and there can be only one server per internet.
Once the server is running connect a couple of clients.
Then play a game of checkers across your WiFi!

## Feutures 
If the server cannot find an opponent for you it will put you in a waiting lobby.
You can connect an infinite number of people to the server, and they will all be able to play(dont push it though).
